## What computer scientsists do and why it matters
Computer scientists are problem solvers who can design programmed solutions to real world problems. Computer scientists in addition to write code, analyze problems, design algorithms, and create systems that can be applied across every field. The work that computer scientists do matters because of how integrated technology has become in modern day society. Whether its the GPS in your phone or Smartwatch tracking your calories burned throughout a workout, computer scientists have been building this technological world that is invisible to most users. A lot of tedious tasks have been tackled by both small and big tools developed by computer scientists.

## Approaching a problem as a computer scientist
Take the problem that is given and break it down into smaller problems for easy digestability. Isolate the essential function and work on just that, once the foundation is set, then add the nice to haves. Prior to building out the solution, plan out how it will be done architechturally, plan to scale into a larger project. Constantly iterate and test to find the best solutions and approaches.

## Computer scientists ethical responsibility to the end user and org
For the end user, we are responsible for ensuring safety, reliability and privacy. Taking into account how software can be misused is a huge part of this and can help tackle potential problems and misuse cases. Relay honest and accurate communication to the organization. Whether it is technical limitations, security risks, or timelines. Ensure the product has sufficient testing and will be end user ready for ship time.
